## :hankey: My pet-projects

### [Godfather Bots](https://github.com/Godfather-Bots)
A set of projects that allow you to quickly create bots for VKontakte or Telegram. Also based on abstract projects, you can add a project to any other social network with the ability to create bots. I have been writing this project for as long as I can remember, or rather it is an extension of my diploma work :).

#### [GitLab Telegram Notify](https://github.com/uPagge/gitlab-notification)
Based on Godfather Bots, a bot was implemented to deliver important notifications from GitLab to Telegram. Read more in [this article](https://struchkov.dev/blog/gitlab-telegram-bot/).

### [Haiti Framework](https://github.com/haiti-projects)
None of us like to write boiler code, it's a set of projects that allow us to develop faster, so we have time to lie on the beach.

### [Theme Hugo uBlogger](https://github.com/upagge/uBlogger) | Archive
This is a template for the HUGO static site generator. I used to use it for my blog.
